# Software-Project-Lab-01

This is a git repository for our software project lab-01. <br/>
This is a lab course under our University academic courses with 1.5 credit. At most 3 students in a team need to work on a web/app development project throughout the semester under an individual supervisor. The project is judged and evaluated at the end of the semester by the committee of faculty members and based on the individual performance of the students, the supervisor submits his evaluation form. <br/>
